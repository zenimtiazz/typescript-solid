# Day 01 :clock11:
### Single-responsiblity Principle

> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job. 

- Separate classes for every object.
- Refactor the code.

### Open-closed Principle

````
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
````

### Liskov substitution principle
 ````
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program."

- Small things matters. ;p
